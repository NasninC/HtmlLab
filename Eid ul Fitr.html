<p>As the crescent moon signals the end of Ramadan, India awakens to the vibrant festivities of Eid ul-Fitr. One of the most prominent festivals of the Muslim community, Eid ul-Fitr (or Eid al-Fitr) is celebrated widely across India. It marks the joyous culmination of Ramadan, a month-long period of fasting, spiritual reflection, and heightened devotion. On this day, signalled by the sighting of the new moon, the community awakens to a spirit of renewal and celebration.</p>
