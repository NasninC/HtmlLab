<p>Fruits are seed-bearing structures formed from the ovaries of only flowering plants. A fruit is the soft, pulpy part of a flowering plant that contains seeds. It is formed from the ovaries of angiosperms and is exclusive only to this group of plants.A fruit is the mature, seed-bearing part of a flowering plant (angiosperm) that develops from the ovary after pollination. While botanically encompassing items like vegetables, grains, and nuts, the common culinary use of "fruit" typically refers to the sweet, fleshy part of a plant eaten as a dessert, such as berries, oranges, and apples. </p>
