<p>A vegetable is typically defined as any edible part of a plant, such as the roots, stems, leaves, or flowers, that is used as food, distinguishing it from fruits, nuts, grains, and seeds in common culinary or nutritional use. Botanically, however, a "vegetable" can be any non-reproductive part of a plant, though often a more culinary definition is used, which includes plant parts like tomatoes and peppers that are botanically fruits.</p>
